    Model Training and Evaluation: Training the model on the extracted features and evaluating its accuracy on the test set.

2. Video Classification

This project classifies videos from the UCF101 dataset using TensorFlow and InceptionV3 for feature extraction. The workflow includes:

    Data Fetching and Preprocessing: Fetching videos from the UCF101 dataset and extracting video frames.
    Feature Extraction and Model Training: Using InceptionV3 for frame-level feature extraction and training a classification model.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on validation and test sets.

3. Multiple Classification Models on Various Datasets

This project applies different machine learning models to multiple datasets, including banknote authentication, glass type classification, and loan default prediction. Key steps are:

    Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loading and preprocessing the datasets.
    Model Training and Evaluation: Training models such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting on each dataset and evaluating their performance using various metrics.

4. Polynomial Regression Model

This project explores the use of polynomial features in regression models to predict car prices. The steps involved are:

    Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loading training and test datasets, and encoding categorical features.
